      <p>This week, I’d like to share the first in a two-part series, in which I talk through some architectural examples of two concepts—restoration and obsolescence—that have been floating around in some of the media I’ve been consuming recently. I’m going to start with restoration.</p>

      <p>A couple months ago, I decided that I wanted to begin learning a new language. I have been learning German for about 5 years at this point, and after years of classroom study and living abroad, I have reached a point where the amount of effort it requires to make even a small leap in practical knowledge is sometimes overwhelming.</p>

      <p>Recently I’ve been writing case summaries of Supreme Court decisions for a legal education startup. One of the cases I wrote about this past week is <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife</em> (1992), which concerns an amendment to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The ESA lays out guidelines for what qualifies as a threatened or endangered species, and requires the Secretary of the Interior to use those guidelines to make a list of threatened or endangered species and each species’ critical habitat. Section 7((a)(2)) of the ESA requires federal agencies to consult with the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that any actions the Secretary authorizes will not threaten or harm endangered species or natural habitats. The amendment at issue in <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife</em> eliminated the requirement that agencies funding overseas projects consult the Secretary to evaluate the potential impact of proposed projects on endangered species. After Congress passed the amendment in 1986, Defenders of Wildlife and several other environmental organizations sued then-Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, Jr. under the claim that the amendment unlawfully established a geographic limit to the Endangered Species Act.</p>

      <p>If you’ve ever seen someone stumbling through the street, you may have thought to yourself, “this person’s off their rocker!” The origin of the phrase is unclear, but perhaps I could provide some insight through a different type of “rock”. It’s hard to believe that the survival of every human depends on rocks—the rocks in your inner ear. Without these rocks, it would be really hard to wake up in the morning and brush your teeth for work (which for some, may be a blessing in disguise). If someone crashed into your car, and the rocks in your ear were knocked loose, you would most definitely be dazed and confused. In general, it would be quite uncomfortable attempting to discern the location of your body or your surroundings or really anything at all. These almighty, glorious and life-saving rocks, called otoconia, live in the inner ear of all humans and fortunately, they allow us to understand that our head is in motion.</p>

      <p>This week, I’d like to talk a little bit about concrete, a material that I think has (unfairly) come to be associated primarily with Brutalism, and the divisive, often deeply annoying pro and anti-Brutalism constituencies (c.f., <a href="https://twitter.com/sincerelysofi/status/939311787635126272?lang=en">this</a> old joke, accurate only when extended to both sides of the divide). The only thing I’ll really note on that point is that not all concrete architecture is an example of Brutalism; see, for example, Notre Dame du Raincy, a reinforced concrete church designed by Auguste and Gustave Perret, and one of my favorite buildings. (Almost every element of the exterior and interior is concrete, down to the grill work on the windows.)</p>

      <p>Recently, I’ve been wondering why in some countries we drive cars on the right side of the road while in others we drive them on the left. There must be a good reason for this difference in practice because it appears to achieve the same result just in a mirror image: when we travel on the right side of the road we drive from the left side of the car and when we travel on the left side of the road we drive from the right side of the car. Seems like a ‘tomato’, ‘tomahto’ kind of thing. So I looked it up. Here’s a brief outline of the history.</p>
