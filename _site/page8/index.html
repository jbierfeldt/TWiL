      <p>One of the courses I’ve been taking this quarter has me working pretty closely with some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>’s lesser-known stories, sketches, aphorisms, and diary entries. As a result, I’ve been spending a lot of time in the PT2621.A26 section of our library, where all of the books written by Kafka, written about Kafka, or written about about books written about Kafka (Academia can be confusing, sometimes) are stored. While poking around for some material about a story I was reading which is sometimes called „Der Jäger Gracchus“ (The Hunter Gracchus), I discovered that not-only was the story never published during Kafka’s Lifetime, like most of his work, but that it was never even finished or edited by Kafka himself—it was simply pulled from some of the notebooks discovered in his desk after his death by his friend and editor Max Brod. These notebooks are now part of a collection called the Franz Kafka Ausgabe (FKA) and our library has a complete collection of their facsimiles, published by Stroemfeld Verlag.</p>

      <p>This week I want to talk about my Economics of Education class. Derek Neal, a distinguished researcher in the Economics Department at UChicago, teaches the class. The class has been supremely interesting and has been structured as follows (in Professor Neal’s words): why schools are shitty, why attempts at making them less shitty have been unsuccessful, and how to actually make them less shitty. I’m going to tell you about Professor Neal’s idea to actually make schools less shitty – which is (unsurprisingly) actually a really, really great idea.</p>

      <p>This week I found myself in a rabbit hole of information about small flowers called Chrysanthemums (Don’t worry Mom and Dad, I was still studying as well). In learning about the chrysanthemum, I feel as if I’ve accidentally stumbled into a world of, what I suppose could be called: “cultural biology.”</p>

      <p>Most of the history I’ve been exposed to in an academic setting has been centered on the United States, but this quarter I’m taking a class on colonization in Asia and the Pacific, which has given me some awareness for a few of the important cultural and political conflicts in that region.</p>

      <p>I learned this week about the most important recent development that has happened in Physics. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatories (comprised of two separate facilities 1800 miles apart) detected gravitational waves. This detection is so important because it is the first proof of the existence of these waves that was predicted by Einstein’s relativity theory 100 years ago.</p>
