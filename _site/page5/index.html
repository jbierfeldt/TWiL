      <p>From our human perspective, orcas get off easy. We behold their majesty as graceful creatures of the sea and reinforce their position in the animal kingdom as organisms of great intelligence, seated comfortably atop the food chain, worthy of our respect and awe. Indeed, these attributions are appropriate, but I think we would hold different opinions if we shared the ocean with these “killer whales”. Perhaps if we were a herd of seal, or a pod of dolphin, maybe even a fearsome school of sharks… If someone mentioned an orca in conversation the first thing on our minds would be: “Screw orcas, man. Those guys are jerks.” Allow me to explain.</p>

      <p>Now that summer is fully underway in North America, you can be sure to find garage sales (or “yard sales,” as <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yard-sale.jpg">some Americans</a> call them) in your neighborhood on most Friday and Saturday mornings. From their initial popularization in the ‘60s, their rise to cultural ubiquity in the ‘70s and ‘80s, and up until today, garage sales have shown themselves to be fruitful objects of study for anthropologists and ethnographers interested in the social interactions and relationships formed between American neighbors.</p>

      <p>I’ve been a lifelong–yet mostly casual–fan of motorsports. From NASCAR to off-terrain rally racing, from MotoGP on two-wheels to drag racing on the strip…Anything with a big engine and any number of wheels has always made me want to go outside and drive, fly, run as fast as I can and test the limits of my surroundings. When I was a little kid, I’d mostly watch these events for the spectacle. The engines were loud, dust flew through the air, sometimes there would be a crash, and still, the drivers remained stoic as they soared around the track or blasted forward with incredible speed. Recently, I’ve become interested in the more technical and physical aspects of a particular style of road racing, Formula One.</p>

      <p>If I were to say the words <em>Darwin</em>, <em>Evolution</em>, <em>Religion</em>, and <em>Creation</em> in one sentence, you probably think you already know how it will go. The religious controversy surrounding Charle Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection as laid out in his <em>On the Origin of Species</em> is an old one, championed in our time by such biologists and philosophers as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtkZMAmgHaU">Richard Dawkins</a>  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfTPTFN94o">Daniel Dennett</a>. The argument is so well-known and ingrained in our culture, that the phrases <em>Darwinian</em> and <em>Creationist</em> are often juxtaposed such as to suggest that Darwin himself, while laying out his theory, had it in mind to use science and a <a href="http://thebaffler.com/salvos/material-issue-lears">mechanistic world-view</a> to destroy the the idea that our world and the creatures in it were designed and created by an intelligent God.</p>

      <p>At historical Chinese dig sites, archaeologists find a great number of peculiar artifacts. One artifact in particular, known as <em>bi</em> disks, appear at face value to be flat, plate-like stones made of jade (and sometimes glass) with ornate carvings of dragons, beasts and images of the sky. The exact function of such disks is unknown but interested parties (anthropologists, sociologists and the like…) are immersed in how these objects have transmitted ideas and beliefs over time.</p>

      <p>This quarter, I’m taking an excitingly titled course called “The Public and Private Lives of Insects.” The focus of the course is on the interactions between humans and insects (how they shape our economy and agricultural practices), but to begin, we discussed what exactly an insect is. I had always thought that insects were all of the tiny creatures that one finds crawling in the dirt, climbing up trees, or buzzing around your picnic table, but it turns out that the scientific classification of what constitutes a member of the class <em>Insecta</em> is very specific.</p>
