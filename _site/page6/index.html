      <p>The scientific discovery of stress as a physiological mechanism is a humorous but intriguing tale. Hans Selye, a budding endocrinologist in the 1930s, had been pursuing hormonal communication in the body as a means to begin his career in research. His opportunity arose when one of his colleagues, a biochemist, gave Selye an extract from an ovary to determine what purpose it served for the body. So, Selye injected his lab rats with the ovarian extract daily for a number of months. His results indicated that the extract had created peptic ulcers, enlarged the adrenal glands and shrunk the immune system’s tissues. Selye knew that he was on to something at this point, however he still needed to run a control group. Injected with mere saline solution instead of the ovarian extract, Selye returned to his rats for results. Remarkably, even with the control saline solution, the control rats still had the same peptic ulcers, enlarged adrenal glands and diminished immune system tissues.</p>

      <p>I was just reminded this week of how amazing our ability to produce language is. If you judge by the number of times in your life you have heard the expression „think before you speak!“, you would come to the conclusion that not many people do this. Even fewer, then, think about <em>how</em> they speak before they do, and that is what I would like to bring your attention to this week. Human speech, while astoundingly complex in terms of what it can be used for (proclamations of love, ordering cheeseburgers, or declaring nuclear war), is pretty simple in terms of how it produced.</p>

      <p>I wonder if ant researchers wished they had giant ants to study. Because it would definitely alleviate the back pain from crouching on the sidewalk with a magnifying glass (although giant ants would be extremely terrifying to have walking around). For neuroscientists, the Mauthner cell has somewhat been a “giant ant” for studying how neurons operate in fish and some amphibians. Luckily, I’ll get a chance to experiment with these cells in zebrafish over the summer so I found out some cool stuff about how they work earlier this week.</p>

        Marking the “front” with a Necker Cube

      <p>In a class I’m taking on sensation and perception in the human brain, we recently read a research journal article inquiring about how our visual cortex is able to mark the “front” of an object. The “front” of an object must be clarified because in the actual world—set apart from our individual perceptions of the environment—the surface of an object does not have an objective label for its “front.” Instead, we designate this label to objects according to information we receive, such as an object’s direction of motion. But when this information is absent or weak, or has surfaces that have competing cues for being its “front”, we can then flexibly assign the “front” to an object (e.g. which side is the front of a motionless skateboard?).  The experimenters, Yangqing Xu and Steven Franconeri from Northwestern University (hssss), test these ideas with a modified Necker cube (Demonstration: <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/eye/necker.htm">http://www.yorku.ca/eye/necker.htm</a>) where two different representations of its possible “fronts” are given for participants to perceive. The participants are required to either change their perception when prompted, or change their perception spontaneously and signal when they view a new perception of the cube.</p>

      <p>This week, I got to handle and observe some actual human brains as a part of a Neuroscience class that a friend of mine is taking! She invited me to slip-into the class, which was having a „Brain Demo,“ given by Professors John and Stephanie Cacioppo. We made sure to get seats in the front of the class in order to have a front-row view of the demonstration, but to my surprise, we were all given rubber gloves and encouraged to walk about the classroom and view the multiple different brains they had on display.</p>

      <p>Due to the Earth’s curvature and its 23.5° axial tilt, the Sun’s energy only strikes the Earth’s surface head-on at a specific point, called the subsolar point. At this location, the sun is directly overhead and the very intense rays of sunlight hit the Earth exactly perpendicular to its surface, resulting in an atmospheric effect known as the Hadley Cell (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell</a>).</p>
