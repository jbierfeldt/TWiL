      <p>We all know that traditional phone calls can sound pretty bad. The other person’s voice sounds tinny and weak, as if they were speaking to you from a metal box submerged 15 feet in motor oil. At least that’s how I’ve always thought of it. For years, nobody really complained about this, though, because a decrease in voice quality seemed a small price to pay for the miracle of being able to speak to anyone you want anywhere in the world at any time. Then came the popularization of smart phones and applications like Skype and FaceTime. “You sound really clear!” That’s what people usually say the first time I give them a FaceTime Audio call. But why is there such a big difference between traditional phone calls placed over the phone network and data-based apps that use the data network?</p>

      <p>Previously, I’ve written some tidbits here involving the mechanisms of movement in organisms (see <a href="/2017/09/11/bug-nuisances.html">Bug Nuisances</a>, <a href="/2016/04/30/mauthner-cell.html">The Mauthner Cell</a>, and <a href="/2017/10/17/wrasse-research.html">Wrasse Research</a>) and I want to continue that trend with some peculiar creatures dwelling in the ocean deep: Ascidians of the subphylum Tunicata, also known as “<a href="http://www.realmonstrosities.com/2012/08/sea-squirt.html">sea squirts</a>.”</p>

      <p>This past Monday, I drove up to Lake Forest College to <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/bones-of-the-city-rebecca-graff-mecca-worlds-fair/">interview an urban archaeologist</a>. Lake Forest, the North Shore suburb that houses the school, is a fantastical place; the streets are all mazy, narrow dead-ends flanked by twenty-foot hedges, apparently designed to baffle and intimidate outsiders in equal measure. Brief glimpses of the massive houses penned inside the foliage are enough to verify that Chicago’s old industrial class, like the members of the meatpacking Armour family, collectively chose the suburb as a retreat in the late 19th century. A particularly opulent stretch of Lake Drive (next to, well, the lake) runs past breakwater and bridges to the gates of the cemetery where John Hughes is buried. (I felt a bit like Molly Ringwald in <em>Pretty in Pink</em>; if anyone had stopped to talk to me, the smell of their wealth might easily have scared me into silence.)</p>

      <p>Since graduating in June, I’ve spent all of my weekdays “working”, if you will, on campus at UChicago performing research on fish.  I figured I’d spend some time writing about my days to take a break from some reading I should be doing. The broader goal of my lab work is to discover exactly how organisms sense their environment and what happens to their motor control upon loss of the sensory system.</p>

      <p>Schools play an inordinately large role in the life of a child—especially in the United States, where schools are usually the center and lifeblood of juvenile social life, providing clubs, sports, and other after-school activities. Speaking from my experience, the schools I attended were such a central pillar of my young life, that it seemed impossible for me that other children built their lives around similar, yet slightly differing systems. It wasn’t until I got to college that I learned that many American children don’t attend a “junior high school” for grades 7–8, but instead are in “middle school” from grade 5 until grade 8. Even now, knowing that my experience with the organization of the school system in my home town is not the same experience as every other American, I still find it difficult to imagine anything else.</p>

      <p>Why is it so hard to swat a fly? Maybe it’s just me, but my dealings with flies usually end in defeat. A fly can land and lift off from a surface seemingly in a split-second. They can twist and turn through the air with acrobatic finesse. To make matters worse, flies might as well have the ability to see the future since they zoom away, leaving me breathless and perplexed once I come back from a swat empty-handed. To abate my frustration, I searched for the secret to their sorcery. It lies within two small parts of their anatomy: halteres and ocelli.</p>
