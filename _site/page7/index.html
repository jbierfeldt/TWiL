      <p>When many people encounter the term „Animal Rights“ (sometimes followed by the word activist), they think of long-haired Hippie-Types chaining themselves to trees or bison, burning down factory-farms, and throwing red paint („lamb’s blood“) on people wearing fur coats. In my Animal Studies course, I encountered a few philosophers and ethicists writing on the subject of „Animal Rights“ (although not all agree with the use of this term) and discovered that even among pro-vegetarian thinkers, there exist many different theoretical and practical positions on how non-human animals should be considered and treated by humans.</p>

      <p>What’s at stake when people make music? Well…a lot of things. We opened up with this question on the first day of a class on “world-music”. The underlying field: Ethnomusicology, the study of people making music. Other questions that were brought up:</p>

      <p>In Australian Sign Language (otherwise known as Auslan), the sign for LIBRARY is signed by moving the dominant hand next to the head and opening and closing the middle and index fingers into the thumb, a motion similar in form to the opening and closing of a hair clip. Like all languages, even spoken ones, signs in signed languages do not need to be iconic or representative of their significants; but the story of how this sign came to be also serves as a great example of how languages change and form.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, I attended a small Linguistics colloquium lead by Gaja Jarosz concerning Sonority Sequencing in the Polish language. After listening somewhat intently, taking some notes and completing some Google searches, I had more or less figured out what these words meant and so I’ll attempt to explain the results of this research. Jackson, I apologize in advance for my attempt at explaining linguistics ☺</p>

      <p>This week’s update centers around a single book, the story of how I got it, what I learned from it, and what I’m now doing with it. The book is called „Die Pflanze als Erfinder“ (The Plant as Inventor), and was written in 1920 by Austro-Hungarian Botanist Raoul Heinrich Francé. In it, Francé lays the ground-thoughts for what he called, and we today still call, Biotechnics (Biotechnik), the study of the structural machinery (seed dispersal, water-pumping, heating, etc.) developed by plants.</p>

      <p>This week I had a very interesting experience that gave me some insight into the process that this university uses to evaluate potential professors. My professor is a prominent member of the philosophy department, and had to attend a talk given by a prospective professor, Matthias Haase from Universität Leipzig. My class was invited to attend the talk in order to see firsthand what it’s like to try to become a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
