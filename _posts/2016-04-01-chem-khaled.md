What’s at stake when people make music? Well…a lot of things. We opened up with this question on the first day of a class on “world-music”. The underlying field: Ethnomusicology, the study of people making music. Other questions that were brought up:

*   How is sound meaningful? Why?
*   What is music? (“Humanly organized sound” according to ethnomusicologist John Blacking) What is world music?
*   How does music express who we are as individuals? (Someone mentioned Kanye West)
*   How do musicians talk about sound?

To begin answering these questions we started with a folk music called *Rai*, emanating from the working classes in the port city of Oran, Algeria around the 1920s. French colonization of Algeria had produced a poor and uneducated class of men and women, thus *Rai* developed at the margins of the unrepresented, from an impoverished population that sought to express freedom of thought through music, to articulate Diaspora, and detail the encounter of difference. *Rai* translated from Arabic means “my opinion” and the content of the genre ran counter to the more readily accepted classical and refined poetry of traditional Algerian music. As a result, *Rai* was ostracized until the 1980s, where it re-emerged with the usage of electronic synthesizers, drum machines and other recording technologies. In the 1980’s *Rai* became *Chab rai* or “rai of the young” as it was pushed through mass media within the age of new cassette technology, bypassing the parents and reaching the youth.
