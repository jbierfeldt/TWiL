This Week in Learning (TWiL) is a project started by Jackson and Chris when they were sophomores in college. Originally conceived of as a weekly newsletter sent to family and friends, they wanted to find a way to keep their people back home up-to-date on some of the interesting things they learned each week. TWiL updates are a way to write informally, yet informatively, about topics, happenings, and oddities we encounter in our lives.
